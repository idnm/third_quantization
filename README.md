# Third quantization
Get Liouvillian in third quantization from Hamiltonian and jump operators.

This is a supplementary Mathematica notebook accompanying preprint [???](). Preview is available on a Wolfram Cloud [third_quantization](https://www.wolframcloud.com/obj/nnemkov/Published/third_quantization.nb).
Requires [NCAlgebra](https://github.com/NCAlgebra/NC). This notebook is not a comprehensive package and its main role is to help verifying computations in the preprint. However, it can be used to automatically construct and diagonalize Liouvillians for free systems in third quantization, taking as input Hamiltonian and jump operators.
